    <section>
      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>Founded in 2025, AeroFinder was born from a simple observation: modern travelers waste hours comparing flight options across multiple platforms. We're committed to revolutionizing flight search through intelligent aggregation and AI-powered personalization.</p>

      <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>Comprehensive Flight Search</h4>
        <p>We partner directly with leading travel APIs including Amadeus and Skyscanner to bring you real-time prices from over 800 airlines and 200+ booking platforms. Unlike basic comparison tools, we include budget carriers, charter flights, and loyalty-program options in every search.</p>
